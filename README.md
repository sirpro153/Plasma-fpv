# FPV Drone Project

This repository documents my Hack Club funded project to build an FPV drone
for learning flight control systems, electronics, and safe drone operation.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a manually controlled FPV quadcopter using
standard drone hardware. The goal is educational: understanding motors, ESCs,
flight controllers, power systems, and firmware configuration.

## Scope
- Manual flight only
- No payload carrying
- No dropping mechanisms
- No autonomous long-range flight

## Current Status
- Hardware selection and safety planning
- Preparing bill of materials

## Planned Work
- Frame and electronics assembly
- Flight controller configuration
- ESC and motor testing
- Controlled flight testing
- Documentation and build logs

This repository will be updated with build progress, configuration files,
photos, and notes throughout the project.
